Is this thing on? \*taps mic, loud mic feedback...\*

Hello everyone. I am Willian Carvalho and today we will talk about attempting to write blog posts.

How many times have you tried to create a blog and work on it? Me? I don't know, maybe this is the third or fourth attempt.

I have succeeded slightly and briefly in the past. Wrote some stuff about programming here and there, but nothing fancy or too deep.

Most of times I was primarily writing for myself, as a journal of things I've learned. Basically what used to be a text file somewhere on my emails, or Dropbox became publicly available in the hope that someone else could benefit from that.

My motivation this time is almost the same, but with a bigger focus on sharing my experience.

I was also inspired by my friend [Gilmar Soares](https://linuxsoares.github.io/), who has provided some cool content on his blog.
I actually "stole" his idea of using Github Pages to create my blog. Thanks, Gilmar!

More speficially Observability, Kubernetes and Go. Or a combination of them. Or not.

Time will tell...
