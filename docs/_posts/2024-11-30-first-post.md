Is this thing on? \*taps mic, loud mic feedback...\*

Hello everyone. I am Willian Carvalho and today we will talk about attempting to write blog posts.

How many times have you tried to create a blog and worked on it? Me? Maybe this is the third or fourth attempt.

I have succeeded slightly and briefly in the past. Wrote some stuff about programming here and there, but nothing fancy or too deep.

Most of times I was primarily writing for myself, as a journal of things I'd learned. Basically what used to be a text file somewhere on my emails or Dropbox became publicly available in a hope that someone else could benefit from it.

My motivation this time is almost the same, but with a bigger focus on sharing my experience.
More speficially Observability, Kubernetes and Go. Or a combination of them. Or not.

I was also inspired by my friend [Gilmar Soares](https://linuxsoares.github.io/), who provides cool content on his blog.
I actually "stole" his idea of using Github Pages to create my blog. Thanks, Gilmar!

Hopefully see you folks soon!
